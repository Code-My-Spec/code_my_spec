  # reachable from `run_script` and neither on an agent's direct surface. A main
  # agent measured on 2026-09-20 called `list_notifications` first because the
  # prompt told it to, got `Unknown tool`, and then did exactly what
  # `OperatingRules` requires of it: reported the failure, refused to work
  # around it, and stopped. It never reached `start_task`.
  #
  # So the prompt talked the agent out of the loop the prompt was sent to start.
  # `Tools.GetNextRequirement` and `Tools.StartTask` are on the engine's list;
  # nothing else named here was.
