  @moduledoc """
  Where built images live, and how they stop costing money.

  Backed by the object storage the storage step already provisions, which is
  the whole reason to run one: retention is the bucket lifecycle rule we have
  already written and already debugged against Hetzner's Ceph, rather than a
  garbage collector nobody remembers to run. Registries fill disks silently —
  every image ever built stays until something deletes it — and that is the
  part of self-hosting one that actually bites.

  The other reason is what it takes *out* of the deploy path. Pulling from here
  means nothing in a deploy needs a GitHub credential, and a GitHub outage does
  not stop Sam deploying — which was the point of moving the build off Actions
  in the first place (story 992).

  This owns the registry's bucket, its retention, and the address an image is
  pulled from. The registry service itself runs on the shared host; this is not
  an implementation of the registry protocol.
