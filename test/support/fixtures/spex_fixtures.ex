  @moduledoc """
  Approved bridge from spex tests into app-level DB setup.

  Specs can only reach into the app through this module. The boundary
  enforces it: `CodeMySpecSpex` depends on `CodeMySpecSpex.Fixtures`,
  not on `CodeMySpec` or `CodeMySpecTest` directly.

  Only surfaces fixtures for state that **originates server-side and
  syncs into the local app** — users, accounts, projects. Components
  and stories are surface-creatable through MCP tools, so spex tests
  drive them directly via `CodeMySpecSpex.ComponentHelpers` and
  `CodeMySpecSpex.StoryHelpers`. Local-only state
  (ProjectConfiguration, etc.) must be set up through the UI like
  any other user action.
